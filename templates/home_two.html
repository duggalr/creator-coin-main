              Meat always comes to us from the same supplier. For years it has
              not disappointed us with quality. It is usually fresh, sometimes
              frozen. At least 3 times a week.

            <p>
              The quality of the beef served at Whiskey in the Jar is so high
              that it is a shame to spoil its flavor with too many spices. We
              are minimalist with respect to the issue. Just before putting on
              the barbecue, the meat is lightly sprinkled with Himalayan salt
              and black hammered pepper.
